<abstract>
  In this work we investigate a class of random walks that interacts with its
  environment called Tree Builder Random Walk (TBRW). In our settings, at each
  step, the walker adds a random number of vertices to its position sampled
  according to a distribution \(Q\). Previous works showed that the walker is
  ballistic with a well-defined speed, and that the TBRW admits a renewal
  structure, meaning that the process can be split into i.i.d epochs. We show
  that the first renewal time has exponential tail. Moreover, we leverage this
  light tail and also show a large deviation result for the distance of the
  walker from the root.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    We investigate a class of random walks in which the walker interacts with
    its environment by modifying the underlying graph. In this model, the walker
    can add a random number of vertices to its position as it walks. This
    ability to alter the structure of the environment introduces a feedback
    mechanism, distinguishing this class of random walk from the classical
    Random Walk on Random Environment model [cite ??] and from more recent
    models where the walker changes its environment but keeping the underlying
    graph structure unchanged, here we have reinforced random walks (cite ??).
    In random walk theory, one of the main questions regards
    transience/recurrence of the walker. When it comes to transient random
    walks, one possible reason for the walker not visit its initial position
    infinitely often is that it ``escapes to infinity''. That is, its distance
    from its initial position goes to infinity. Notice that notion of distance
    comes naturally from the graph structure of the environment, then we can
    also quantify ``how fast'' the walker escapes to infinity by introducing a
    notion of speed at a given time which is naturally defined as $$
    \frac{{\text{distance of the walker from a fixed point at time }n}}{n}. $$
    The notion of speed lead us to class of
    <i>ballistic</i> random walks. A random walk is <i>ballistic </i> if
    <equation-block id="eq:ballistic">
      \liminf_{n\to \infty}\frac{{\text{distance of the walker from fixedpoint
      at time }n}}{n} >0,
    </equation-block>
    almost surely. Ballistic walkers are moving away from their initial position
    at a linear speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all transient walkers are ballistic, the classical example being the
    simple symmetrical random walk on \(\mathbb{Z}^d\) for \(d\ge 3\). In this
    case, the walker can wander too much over the environment, exhibiting a
    diffusive behavior. The relation between transience and ballisticity can be
    a truly hard problem. In the classical theory of RWRE, the question whether
    directional transience implies ballisticity, even in the most standard
    settings, remains open since the influential work of Solomon in the 1970's
    and the works of Sniztman in the end of the 90s. In [??] Sniztman
    conjectured that for RWRE in \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), a directional random walk on
    a random variable under the so-called uniformly elliptic condition is
    ballistic.

      <title>Exponential tail of \(\tau_1\)</title>
      Consider a TBRW with leaf distribution \(Q\) and fix \(\kappa\in (0,1]\),
      then there exists a constant \(c\) depending on \(\kappa\) only, such that
      $$ \sup_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_\kappa}P_Q(\tau_1 \ge n) \le e^{-cn}. $$

  <h1>Proof of <a-ref to="t:tautail"></a-ref></h1>

  <p>
    n \cite{ribeiro2023}, the authors construct a renewal structure for the
    BGRW, which makes it possible to analyze the process as i.i.d epochs. In
    this part, we will define this renewal structure and show that the first
    renewal time has exponential tail.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we define the renewal structure, let us say a couple words about the
    markovian nature of the TBRW. Observe that the TBRW itself is a Markov
    process on the space of rooted trees, even though each of its components
    separately are not. In some proofs, it will be useful to make use of the
    (Strong) Markov Properties. For that, we will denote the shift operator of
    length \(n\) by \(\theta_n\). In light of the Markov Properties, it is
    important to point out that when the TBRW is shifted by \(n\) steps and
    \(\mathcal{L}_n = Q\) for all \(n\), the shifted process is a TBRW that
    starts from a random initial state \((T_n,X_n)\) and with the exact same
    sequence of laws \(\{\mathcal{L}_n\}_n\). More formally, if \(\phi: \Omega
    \to \mathbb{R}\) is \(\mathcal{F}\)-measurable, then the Simple Markov
    Property works as follows $$ E_{T_0,X_0;Q}\left [\phi\circ \theta_n \;
    \middle | \; \mathcal{F}_n\right] = E_{T_n,X_n;Q}\left [\phi\right]. $$
